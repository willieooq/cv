      Education

    <h3>Personal Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Since I was a child, I have liked doing things in myself. Compared with
      the knowledge in books, I prefer to learn by completing something.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>Programming Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The language I used when I wrote Line Bot was <b>Python</b>，Because
        there was almost no programming experience at that time, So I made a lot
        of stupid mistakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Java</b> project was unexpected, though I only planned to do a small
        topic, I dive in to the project, and got the highest score in the class.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>C++</b>Only the foundation of the school, there is no more in-depth
        study.
      </li>
      <li>
        My <b>Github</b> is not very experienced, still working hard to learn
        it.
      </li>
    </ul>

            In order to solve the most difficult problem in the universe, I
            planned to use google map to find restaurants at the beginning, but
            some information were not found in the data, so manual surveys were
            used, then read and write data through excel.

        <td>
          In order to facilitate the public to report abandoned bicycles. We
          decided to use LINE, because of its convenience, to build a reporting
          system<br />
          and also uses image recognition to assist bicycle judgment.
